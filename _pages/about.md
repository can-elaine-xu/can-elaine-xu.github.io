# About Me

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/me.jpg  | absolute_url"}}"
width="50%" hspace="20" align="right">

I am currently a doctoral student in [Department of Speech, Language,   
and Hearing Sciences at University of Texas at Austin][1], working in [Speech Psychophysics Lab][2]  
under the mentorship of [Dr. Chang Liu][3]. I am also a part-time graduate research assistant  
in [Texas Auditory Neuroscience Lab][4], advised by [Dr. Spencer B. Smith][5].

My major research interest includes neural encoding of speech at the subcortical level,  
mainly evaluated by frequency following responses (FFR) and its behavioral correlates.  
I am interested to look at the effect of listeners' experience on the neural responses,  
including tonal language experience and cochlear implant users.

I have a Bachelor's degree in English and a Master's degree in Linguistics from  
Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, where I did my thesis on  
XXX. After spending some time pursuing other interests,[^fnote2] I began working on my
Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at University of Colorado. My dissertation covers a
range of topics in statistics, data analytics, and understanding noisy
systems. For more details on all that, check out [my portfolio](/portfolio/), or
take a look at [my resume][4].

	[Great Vow Zen Monastery][3], where we followed a daily schedule of work and
	meditation.)
